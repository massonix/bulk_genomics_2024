This repository contains a 2024 version of how to run end-end buk genomics / transcriptomics / epigenomics analysis


## Nf-core pipelines

While methods for single-cell genomics are still under active development, methods for bulk genomcis have been consolidated into robust pipelines accepted by the community. As such, computational biologists across the globe have curated reproducible and portable pipelines to run common bioinformatics workflows. The most successful attempt at that are the [nf-core pipelines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0439-x), which unleash the power of [Nextflow](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3820) and [containers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-023-00244-9.pdf) to achieve such reproducibility. These are the most common nf-core pipelines

- ATAC-seq ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/atacseq/2.1.2) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/atacseq/tree/2.1.2) )
- ChIP-seq ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/2.0.0) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/chipseq/tree/2.0.0) )
- RNA-seq ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/tree/3.14.0) )
- WGS ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/sarek/3.4.0) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek/tree/3.4.0) ): detection of somatic or germline variants from WGS data
- HiC ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/hic/2.1.0/docs/usage) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/hic) )
- methylation ([documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/2.6.0) / [github](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq) )


To learn how NextFlow works I recommend [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbtMbJTo1xo&list=PLPZ8WHdZGxmUVZRUfua8CsjuhjZ96t62R) from Elvan Floden, one of Nextflow's developers.


## RNA-seq


## Aligners for RNA-seq

- STAR ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/1/15/272537?login=false) / [github](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)): STAR is a read aligner designed for splice aware mapping typical of RNA sequencing data. STAR stands for Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference, and has been shown to have high accuracy and outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, but it is memory intensive.
- Why do I see non-integer / float values in the expression matrix derived from Salmon? Rob Patro's answer: _Salmon performs probabilistic allocation of the fragments, to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the transcript abundances given the observed data (read alignments)_. Also explained in the documentation: _Observed library format counts. When run in mapping-based mode, the quantification directory will contain a file called lib_format_counts.json. This JSON file reports the number of fragments that had at least one mapping compatible with the designated library format, as well as the number that didn't. It also records the strand-bias that provides some information about how strand-specific the computed mappings were. Finally, this file contains a count of the number of mappings that were computed that matched each possible library type. These are counts of mappings, and so a single fragment that maps to the transcriptome in more than one way may contribute to multiple library type counts. Note: This file is currently not generated when Salmon is run in alignment-based mode._

## Transcript quanfication

- Salmon( [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4197) / [documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html) ), from the nf-core pipeline documentation: _Salmon from Ocean Genomics is a tool for wicked-fast transcript quantification from RNA-seq data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or de-novo assembly) in order to perform quantification. All you need to run Salmon is a FASTA file containing your reference transcripts and a set of FASTA/FASTQ/BAM file(s) containing your reads. The transcriptome-level BAM files generated by STAR are provided to Salmon for downstream quantification. You can of course also provide FASTQ files directly as input to Salmon in order to pseudo-align and quantify your data by providing the --pseudo_aligner salmon parameter. The results generated by the pipeline are exactly the same whether you provide BAM or FASTQ input so please see the Salmon results section for more details._

## DESeq2

DESEQ2 is one of the main "Swiss Army knives" used to analyse RNA-seq data. As such, it is crucial to understand how it works, which data structures utilizes and how it interacts with other packages:

- [Original DESeq paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)
- [DESeq2 paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8#Bib1)
- [RNA-seq workflow](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html): an end-end RNA-seq analysis using BioConductor packages (from the developers of DESeq2)
- [DESeq2 workflow tutorial | Differential Gene Expression Analysis | Bioinformatics 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzNzO8qwwp0): DESeq2 tutorial by the bioinformagician on youtube

Why does DESeq2 use the DESeqDataSet class and not SummarizedExperiment? From the RNA-seq workflow above: _In DESeq2, the custom class is called DESeqDataSet. It is built on top of the SummarizedExperiment class, and it is easy to convert SummarizedExperiment objects into DESeqDataSet objects, which we show below. One of the two main differences is that the assay slot is instead accessed using the counts accessor function, and the DESeqDataSet class enforces that the values in this matrix are non-negative integers._


## Clustering

Which distance metric should I use?

- [Great discussion on stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/459063/best-practices-in-the-selection-of-distance-metric-and-clustering-methods-for-ge). Key questions: _should genes that show the same pattern, but have different levels of overall expression go into the same group (correlation based distance) or different groups (difference based distance)? Is the pattern more important the the overall expression level ? If two genes anti-correlate does that mean they are related and be in the same group, or in different groups (does sign matter)? Should larger deviations be "punished" more (euclidean distance), or all magnitudes of difference are equally important (manhattan distance)?_
- [Check figure 10.13 from the 1st version from the book Introduction to Statistical Learning ](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/rabbee/s154/ISLR_First_Printing.pdf) for an intuitive understanding of why the choice of distance metric matters.
